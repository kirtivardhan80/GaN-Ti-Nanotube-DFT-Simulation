# 🧪 GaN-Ti Nanotube DFT Simulation

This repository contains a simulation-based study on the structural, electronic, and mechanical properties of Titanium-doped Gallium Nitride (GaN-Ti) in both bulk and nanotube forms. The project was conducted using BIOVIA Materials Studio with Density Functional Theory (DFT), and includes an in-depth elastic tensor analysis.
